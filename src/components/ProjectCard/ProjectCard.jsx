          The model we used is built with Keras using Convolutional Neural
          Networks (CNN). A convolutional neural network is a special type of
          deep neural network which performs extremely well for image
          classification purposes. A CNN basically consists of an input layer,
          an output layer and a hidden layer which can have multiple layers. A
          convolution operation is performed on these layers using a filter that
          performs 2D matrix multiplication on the layer and filter.
